How version control works?

How can multiple users copmare, update & store on same file?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manually choosing when to create a commit can sometimes lead  to early or late commit the change which will effect when we compare 2 versions in future

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
When we save files on Goole docs it stores & treates it like a seperate enitity. But on Git, it allows all the files as one enitity though all the files from that enitity haven't changed.
So that we can retrive all the changes done in a particular commit
